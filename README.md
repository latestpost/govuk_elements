## Interview Test

This fork has been made to create a basic questionaire form.

The form should consist of the following fields/copy below and styles must match with GOVUK styles provided.

The form must post to a mongo database and the answers must displayed on the next page. We’ll leave it up to you on how this page looks.

Form validation is not necessary (only if you have time)

Files must be in a public Git repository and link to be sent to us.

Please spend no more than an hour on this task. What's important for us is that we understand if you are able to create rapid working prototypes and use consistent GOVUK patterns and styling. If your sample gives us this confidence we can then progress to the next stage.
